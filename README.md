# WordleSolver
The application that helps in solving Literalnie / Wordle puzzles

This particular version of the application helps the user to solve Literalnie's (PL version of Wordle) puzzles.
The aim here is to provide the user the words that would fit the constraints that are being imposed with every guess:

eg. first guess: "bluza" - we did the first try in the "Literalnie" app and got one letter, "z" right - not only we guessed the letter, we also got the position correctly. 
Now, "WordleSolver" will filter the database and provide the user the words which have "z" letter on the right spot (i.e. 4th) and do not contain letters b, l, u, a.
Another guess: procedure continues with another letters to be or not to be included in search filter.
